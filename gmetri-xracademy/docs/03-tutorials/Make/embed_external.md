# Embed a Gmetri Experience into your website

## Description

After creating an [experience](../../../Features/Create/experiences/) on the Gmetri platform, you have an option to embed it into your own website and enrich the user experience multi-fold!

## Get the embed code from your experience

After you have created your experience, you must have a live deployment for it. For more information on this, see [deployments](../../../Features/Publish/).

### Embed it as part of a page

1. In your Experience page, expand the live deployment that you want to embed.

2. From `Sharing Options`, select `Embed`.

    Here, you can change the metadata such as the title to be shown and the description by clicking `Metadata` below.

3. Change the width and height of the iframe according to your needs. You can always change this later by changing the values in the code.

4. Copy the given iframe code by clicking on the little `copy` icon.

5. Paste it in your webpage where you need and voila!

### Embed it as a full-screen experience

Instead of restricting the experience space to only part of a page, you may also add a hyperlink in your website and link it to a full-screen webpage of your experience. You can also use this to create a pop-up window of your experience.

1. In your Experience page, expand the live deployment that you want to embed.

2. From `Sharing Options`, select `Full Screen`.

3. Copy the embed code provided and paste it in a new page in your website, or download this code into an HTML file by clicking on `Download .HTML`.
