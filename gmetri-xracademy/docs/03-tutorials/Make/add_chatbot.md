## Description

A chatbot allows you to interact with users. GMetri platform allows experience creators to add third-party chat bots to the XR experiences.

This simple experience demonstrates chatbot integration on GMetri.

- We use [Landbot.io](https://landbot.io/) as the external service for the chatbot in this tutorial, but you can use any chatbot of your choice.
